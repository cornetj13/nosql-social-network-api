# NoSQL Social Network Backend

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green?style=plastic)

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Description

A mock social network backend API created using MongoDB, Mongoose.js, and Express.js. This server uses mongoDB for database storage, mongoose schemas to create models, and express API endpoints to achieve full CRUD functionality. Furthermore, this application leverages mongoose virtuals, getters, and validation for strict data-entry control. This application also meets the following acceptance criteria:

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

Seeding the data looks as follows:

A PUT example looks as follows:

A DELETE example looks as follows:
